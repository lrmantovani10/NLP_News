**NLP Project on Sentiment Analysis regarding AI publications**

Repository which aims to analyze sentiment regarding artificial intelligence in the Guardian's publications. 
This project was led by the University of Chicago's Institute of Politics (IOP) Tech Team, and aimed to divide students into smaller groups with
shared political themes of their choice. Each group could then edit the base code provided by the IOP to extract data from the chosen newspaper's API
and run sentiment analysis on the publications concerning their topic. 
I chose the theme of Artificial Intelligence, so I ran sentiment analysis on publications containing words about this theme. My main goals were to unerstand how 
the media responds to increased research and development of Machine Learning (and, more specifically, neural networks): are breakthroughs in this
field regarded with pessimism and fear? If so, could this be a factor promoting AI aversion among he broader population? If not, could articles
that refer to AI in a positive tone help reverse this trend? The analsyis obtained from this code aims to discuss these questions.
