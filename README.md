**NLP Project***

Project which aims to analyze sentiment regarding artifiical intelligence in the Guardian's publications. 
This project was led by the University of Chicago's Institute of Politics (IOP) Tech Team, and aimed to divide students into smaller groups with
shared political themes of their choice. Each group could then edit the base code provided by the IOP to extract data from the chosen newspaper's API
and run sentiment analysis on the publications concerning the topic of their choice. 
I chose the theme of Artificial Intelligence, so I ran sentiment analysis on publications concerning this theme. My main goals were to unerstand how 
the media responds to increased research and development of Machine Learning (and, more specifically, neural networks): are breakthroughs in this
field regarded with pessimism and fear? If so, could this be a factor promoting AI aversion among he broader population? If not, could positive article
impression of AI help reverse this trend? The analsyis obtained from this code aims to discuss these questions.
